        <p>
Many topological properties may be characterized in terms of who can guarantee victory (and how much memory they require) in certain two-player, infinite-length games. To illustrate this, we will explore a novel game-theoretic proof of the uncountability of the real numbers, and then discuss the class of "selection games" used throughout general topology.
        </p>
<!--        <p>
Several ideas from topology and set theory may be characterized by considering two-player infinite-length games. During each round <m>n\in\omega=\{0,1,2,\dots\}</m>, suppose Player 1 makes a move <m>a_n</m> (perhaps choosing an open cover of a given regular space), followed by Player 2 making a move <m>b_n</m> (perhaps choosing a finite subcollection from 1's chosen cover); the winner of such a game is determined by the sequence of moves <m>a_0,b_0,a_1,b_1,\dots</m> (perhaps Player 2 wins if their choices form a cover).
        </p>
        <p>
The topological game specified above is known as Menger's game, and Player 2 has an unbeatable strategy that only uses information limited to the round number and the most recent move of Player 1 in this game if and only if the given regular space is <m>\sigma</m>-compact. In this talk, we will explore various results of this flavor found in the literature, including an interesting game-theoretic proof appropriate for undergraduates that the real numbers are uncountable.

        <title>The Cantor Game</title>
        <p>
Let <m>W\subseteq\mathbb R</m>.
Then <m>CG(W)</m> denotes the following game played by players <m>P1</m>
and <m>P2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
During round <m>0</m>, <m>P1</m> chooses some real number <m>a_0</m>,
followed by <m>P2</m> choosing <m>b_0</m> such that <m>a_0\lt b_0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
During round <m>n+1</m>, <m>P1</m> chooses <m>a_{n+1}\in(a_n,b_n)</m>,
followed by <m>P2</m> choosing <m>b_{n+1}\in(a_{n+1},b_n)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
After <m>\omega=\{0,1,2,\dots\}</m>-many rounds,
<m>P1</m> wins this game in the case
that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\in W</m>.
        </p>
        <image source="img/cg.png"/>
        <p>
(This game seems to be introduced by Grossman and Turett
in the problems section of Mathematics Magazine Vol. 71,
with some further analysis done by Matt Baker in a later volume.)

        <title>Strategies</title>
        <p>
It'd take some time to complete this kind of
<term><m>\omega</m>-length game</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
However, each player in such a game can define a <term>strategy</term>
<m>\sigma:M^{\lt\omega}\to M</m>
that designates their moves in response to their opponent's actions...
        </p>
        <me>
\underbrace{\sigma}_{\text{player strategy}} :
\underbrace{M^{\lt\omega}}_{\text{finite sequence of opponent's moves}} \to
\underbrace{M}_{\text{player's next move}}
        </me>
        <p>
Typically, we want to prove something about the existence of
<term>winning strategies</term> that defeat any counter-strategy chosen
by the opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
If player <m>P</m> has a winning strategy for game <m>G</m>,
we write <m>P\win G</m>.

            <p>
Let <m>W=\{w_n:n\in\omega\}</m>. Then if any element of

their strategy is to play <m>w_n</m>, where <m>n</m> is
the minimal ordinal such that <m>w_n</m> is legal to play.
Otherwise, <m>P2</m> chooses arbitrarily.

            <p>
At the end of the game, each element <m>w_N\in W</m> was either played
before round <m>N</m>, or was illegal to be played in round <m>N</m>.
Either way, <m>w_N\not=\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n</m>,
so <m>P2</m>'s strategy is winning.

      <title>Selection Games</title>
      <slide>
        <title>Definition</title>
        <p>
          Given two sets <m>\mc A,\mc B</m>, the selection game <m>G_1(\mc A,\mc B)</m>
          is played as follows:
        </p>
        <image source="/img/sg.png"/>
        <p>
          <m>P2</m> wins this game provided <m>\{b_n:n\lt\omega\}\in\mc B</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>G_{fin}(\mc A,\mc B)</m> is similar, except <m>P2</m> can make
          finitely-many selections each round.
        </p>
      </slide>
      <slide>
        <title>Topological Examples</title>
        <p>Let <m>X</m> be some topological space with a particular point <m>x</m>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>G_*(\mc O,\mc O)</m>:
            P1 chooses open covers of <m>X</m>,
            P2 tries to build their own open cover.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>G_*(\mc D,\Gamma_x)</m>:
            P1 chooses dense subsets of <m>X</m>,
            P2 tries to build a sequence converging to <m>x</m>.

      <slide>
        <title>Limited Information</title>
        <p>
          A strategy that can ignore all but the most recent move of the opponent
          (but might use the current round #) is said to be Markov.
        </p>
        <p>
          A strategy that can ignore all moves of the opponent
          (but probably uses the current round #) is said to be predetermined.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>X=\mathbb R</m> with the usual topology:

          <li>
            <m>P1\prewin G_1(\mc O,\mc O)</m>
            but
            <m>P2\markwin G_{fin}(\mc O,\mc O)</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>P2\markwin G_1(\mc D,\Gamma_0)</m>
            (so <m>P2\markwin G_{fin}(\mc D,\Gamma_0)</m> also).

            For second-countable spaces,

            Using the Continuum Hypothesis and the Axiom of Choice, one may construct Lusin sets
            <m>X\subseteq\mathbb R</m>. Any Lusin set satisfies both

            (Galvin 1979, Pawlikowski 1994),
            F. Jordan (2020) found a space where <m>P1\win G_1(\mc K,\mc O)</m> but

      <title>Dual Selection Games</title>
      <slide>
        <title>The Point-Open Game</title>
        <p>
          Let <m>\mc O</m> be the set of open covers, and <m>\mc P</m> be the set of
          point-bases. Let <m>\neg</m> denote the complement of a set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the point-open game <m>G_1(\mc P,\neg\mc O)</m> essentially has
          <m>P1</m> choosing points, and <m>P2</m> selecting a neighborhood for each point. Then
          <m>P1</m> wins if <m>P2</m>'s sets form a cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare with <m>G_1(\mc O,\mc O)</m>: <m>P1</m> chooses open covers,
          <m>P2</m> selects an open set from the cover. Here <m>P2</m> wants to build
          the open cover.
         </p>
      </slide>
      <slide>
        <title>Duality</title>
        <p>Galvin (1978) demonstrated the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><m>P1\win G_1(\mc O,\mc O)\Leftrightarrow P2\win G_1(\mc P,\neg\mc O)</m></li>
          <li><m>P2\win G_1(\mc O,\mc O)\Leftrightarrow P1\win G_1(\mc P,\neg\mc O)</m></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following also holds:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><m>P1\prewin G_1(\mc O,\mc O)\Leftrightarrow P2\markwin G_1(\mc P,\neg\mc O)</m></li>
          <li><m>P2\markwin G_1(\mc O,\mc O)\Leftrightarrow P1\prewin G_1(\mc P,\neg\mc O)</m></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All together, we say that these games are dual.</p>
      </slide>
      <slide>
        <title>Reflections</title>
        <p>It turns out that the key to this proof comes from a simple observation:</p>
        <p>
          <q>For each <m>x\in X</m>, pick any neighborhood <m>U_x</m>. Then <m>\{U_x:x\in X\}</m>
          is an open cover.</q>
        </p>
        <p pause="yes">
          Put another way:
        </p>
        <p pause="yes">
          <q>For each <m>B_x\in\mc P</m>, pick any <m>U_x\in B_x</m>. Then <m>\{U_x:B_x\in\mc P\}\in\mc O</m>.</q>
        </p>
        <p pause="yes">
          So let's say <m>\mc R</m> reflects* <m>\mc A</m> given the following:
        </p>
        <p pause="yes">
          <q>For each <m>R\in\mc R</m>, pick any <m>b_R\in R</m>. Then <m>\{b_R:R\in \mc R\}\in\mc A</m>.</q> (*slight simplification)
        </p>
      </slide>
      <slide>
        <title>Another example</title>
        <p>So <m>\mc P</m> refelcts <m>\mc O</m>, and <m>G_1(\mc O,\mc O)</m> and <m>G_1(\mc P,\neg\mc O)</m>
        are dual.</p>
        <p>
           Likewise, let <m>\mc T</m> be the topology of a space, and choose a point from each open set.
           That collection is a dense subspace, a member of <m>\mc D</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
           What can we say about <m>G_1(\mc D,\Gamma_x)</m> and <m>G_1(\mc T,\neg\Gamma_x)</m>?
        </p>
        <p pause="yes">YES, they are dual!</p>
