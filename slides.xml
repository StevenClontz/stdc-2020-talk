        <p>
Several ideas from topology and set theory may be characterized by considering two-player infinite-length games. During each round <m>n\in\omega=\{0,1,2,\dots\}</m>, suppose Player 1 makes a move <m>a_n</m> (perhaps choosing an open cover of a given regular space), followed by Player 2 making a move <m>b_n</m> (perhaps choosing a finite subcollection from 1's chosen cover); the winner of such a game is determined by the sequence of moves <m>a_0,b_0,a_1,b_1,\dots</m> (perhaps Player 2 wins if their choices form a cover).
        </p>
        <p>
The topological game specified above is known as Menger's game, and Player 2 has an unbeatable strategy that only uses information limited to the round number and the most recent move of Player 1 in this game if and only if the given regular space is <m>\sigma</m>-compact. In this talk, we will explore various results of this flavor found in the literature, including an interesting game-theoretic proof appropriate for undergraduates that the real numbers are uncountable.

        <p>
Let <m>W\subseteq\mathbb R</m>.
Then <m>CG(W)</m> denotes the following game played by players <m>I</m>
and <m>II</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
During round <m>0</m>, <m>I</m> chooses some real number <m>a_0</m>,
followed by <m>II</m> choosing <m>b_0</m> such that <m>a_0\lt b_0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
During round <m>n+1</m>, <m>I</m> chooses <m>a_{n+1}\in(a_n,b_n)</m>,
followed by <m>II</m> choosing <m>b_{n+1}\in(a_{n+1},b_n)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
After <m>\omega</m>-many rounds, <m>I</m> wins this game in the case
that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\in W</m>.

(This game seems to be introduced by Grossman and Turett
in the problems section of Mathematics Magazine Vol. 71,
with some further analysis done by Matt Baker in a later volume.)

I've yet to finish playing a single <m>\omega</m>-length game. :-(
        </p>
        <p>
However, both players in such a game can define <term>strategies</term>
that describe how they <term>would</term>...
